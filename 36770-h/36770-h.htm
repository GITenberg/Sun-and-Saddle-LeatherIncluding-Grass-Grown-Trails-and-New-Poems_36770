<h2>
    PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
</h2>

<p>
Cowboys are the sternest critics of those who would represent the West.
No hypocrisy, no bluff, no pose can evade them.
</p>
<p>
Yet cowboys have made Badger Clark's songs their own. So readily have
they circulated that often the man who sings the song could not tell
you where it started. Many of the poems have become folk songs of the
West, we may say of America, for they speak of freedom and the open.
</p>
<p>
Generous has been the praise given <i>Sun and Saddle Leather</i>, but
perhaps no criticism has summed up the work so satisfactorily as the
comment of the old cow man who said, "You can break me if there's a
dead poem in the book, I read the hull of it. Who in H&mdash;&mdash; is this kid
Clark, anyway? I don't know how he knowed, but he <i>knows</i>."
</p>
<p>
That is what proves Badger Clark the real poet. He knows. Beyond his
wonderful

<span class="pagenum"><a id="nopage8" name="nopage8"></a>[pg]</span>

           presentation of the West is the quality of universal appeal
that makes his work real art. He has tied the West to the universe.
</p>
<p>
The old cow man is not the only one who has wondered who Badger Clark
was. Charles Wharton Stork speaking of <i>Sun and Saddle Leather</i>, said,
"It has splendid flavor and fine artistic handling as well. I should
like to know more of the author, whether he was a cow puncher or merely
got inside his psychology by imagination."
</p>
<p>
Badger Clark was brought up in the West. As a boy he lived in Deadwood,
South Dakota. The town at that time was trying to live down the
reputation for exuberant indecorum which she had acquired during the
gold rush; but her five churches operating two hours a week could make
little headway against the competition of two dance halls and
twenty-six saloons running twenty-four hours a day.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="nopage9" name="nopage9"></a>[pg]</span></p>

<p>
Perhaps it was these early impressions that make <i>The Piano at Red's</i>
in Mr. Clark's later volume <i>Grass Grown Trails</i> so vivid.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Scuffling feet and thud of fists, </p>
<p class="i4">     Curses hot as fire&mdash; </p>
<p class="i2">   Still the music sang of love, </p>
<p class="i4">     Longin', lost desire, </p>
<p class="i2">   Dreams that never could have been </p>
<p class="i4">     Joys that couldn't stay&mdash; </p>
<p class="i2">   While the man upon the floor </p>
<p class="i4">     Wiped the blood away. </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
After Clark had grown up, in the cow country near the Mexican border,
he stumbled unexpectedly into paradise. He was given charge of a small
ranch and the responsibility for a bunch of cattle just large enough to
amuse him, but too small to demand a full day's work once a month. The
sky was persistently blue, the sunlight was richly golden, the folds of
the barren mountains and the wide reaches of the range were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="nopage10" name="nopage10"></a>[pg]</span>

                                                            full of many
lovely colors, and his nearest neighbor was eight miles away.
</p>
<p>
The cow men who dropped in for a meal now and then in the course of
their interminable riding appeared to have ridden directly out of books
of adventure, with old-young faces full of sun wrinkles, careless
mouths full of bad grammar, strange oaths and stranger yarns, and
hearts for the most part as open and shadowless as the country they
daily ranged.
</p>
<p>
In the evenings as Clark placed his boot heels on the porch railing,
smote the strings of his guitar and broke the tense silence of the
warm, dry twilight with song, he often wondered, as his eyes rested
dreamily on the spikey yuccas that stood out sharp and black against
the clear lemon color of the sunset west, why hermit life in the desert
was traditionally a sad, penitential affair.
</p>
<p>
In a letter to his mother a month or two

<span class="pagenum"><a id="nopage11" name="nopage11"></a>[pg]</span>

                                         after settling in Arizona he
found prose too weak to express his utter content and perpetrated his
first verses. She, with natural pride, sent the verses to a magazine,
the old <i>Pacific Monthly</i>, and a week or two later the desert dweller
was astonished beyond measure to receive his first editorial check.
The  discovery that certain people in the world were willing to pay
money for such rhymes as he could write bent the whole course of his
subsequent life, for good or evil, and the occasional lyric impulse
hardened into a habit which has consumed much of his time and most of
his serious thought since that date. The verses written to his mother
were <i>Ridin'</i>, the first poem in his first book, <i>Sun and Saddle
Leather</i>, and the greater part of the poems in both <i>Sun and Saddle
Leather</i> and <i>Grass Grown Trails</i> were written in Arizona.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sun and Saddle Leather</i> and <i>Grass Grown Trails</i> are books of Western
songs, simple

<span class="pagenum"><a id="nopage12" name="nopage12"></a>[pg]</span>

              and ringing and yet with an ample vision that makes them
unique among poems written in a local vernacular. The spirit of them
is eternal, the spirit of youth in the open, and their background is
"God's Reserves," the vast reach of Western mesa and plain that will
always remain free&mdash;"the way that it was when the world was new."
</p>
<p>
Every poem carries a breath of plains, wind-flavored with a tang of
camp smoke; and, varied as they are in tune and tone, they do not
contain a single note that is labored or unnatural. They are of native
Western stock, as indigenous to the soil as the agile cow ponies whose
hoofs evidently beat the time for their swinging measures; and it is
this quality, as well as their appealing music, that has already given
them such wide popularity, East and West.
</p>
<p>
That they were born in the saddle and written for love rather than for
publication

<span class="pagenum"><a id="nopage13" name="nopage13"></a>[pg]</span>

            is a conviction that the reader of them can hardly escape.
From the impish merriment of <i>From Town</i> to the deep but fearless piety
of <i>The Cowboy's Prayer</i>, these songs ring true; and are as healthy as
the big, bright country whence they came.
</p>
<p>
In 1917, about the time our first edition of <i>Sun and Saddle Leather</i>
began to run low, we fortunately discovered L. A. Huffman, of Miles
City, Montana, the illustrator who in 1878 began taking photographs
from the saddle with crude cameras he made over to meet his needs.
These same views were the first of the now famous "Huffman Pictures,"
beginning with the Indians and buffaloes round about Ft. Keogh on the
Yellowstone where he was post photographer for General Miles' army
during those stirring territorial days. The Huffman Studio is still one
of the show places of Miles City, and the sales headquarters also for
Montana and adjacent states

<span class="pagenum"><a id="nopage14" name="nopage14"></a>[pg]</span>

                            for both of Mr. Clark's books, <i>Sun and
Saddle Leather</i> and <i>Grass Grown Trails</i>. In a recent letter Mr. Huffman
says, "I have just come back from a trip to 'Powder River' and along the
Wyoming-Montana border. It's all too true! Clark saw and wrote it none
too soon in <i>The Passing of the Trail</i>."
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   The trail's a lane, the trail's a lane. </p>
<p class="i2">   Dead is the branding fire. </p>
<p class="i2">   The prairies wild are tame and mild </p>
<p class="i2">   All close-corralled with wire. </p>
<p class="i2">   The sunburnt demigods who ranged </p>

<p class="i2">   I ride alone and hate the boys I meet. </p>
<p class="i4">     Today, some way, their laughin' hurts me so. </p>

<p class="i2">   What is there out beyond the last divide? </p>

<p class="i2">   One time, 'way back where the year marks fade, </p>
<p class="i4">     God said: "I see I must lose my West, </p>
<p class="i2">   The prettiest part of the world I made, </p>
<p class="i4">     The place where I've always come to rest, </p>
<p class="i2">   For the White Man grows till he fights for bread </p>
<p class="i2">   And he begs and prays for a chance to spread. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "Yet I won't give all of my last retreat; </p>
<p class="i4">     I'll help him to fight his long trail through, </p>
<p class="i2">   But I'll keep some land from his field and street </p>
<p class="i4">     The way that it was when the world was new. </p>
<p class="i2">   He'll cry for it all, for that's his way, </p>

                 And so, from the painted Bad Lands, 'way </p>
<p class="i4">     To the sun-beat home of the 'Pache kin, </p>
<p class="i2">   God stripped some places to sand and clay </p>
<p class="i4">     And dried up the beds where the streams had been. </p>
<p class="i2">   He marked His reserves with these plain signs </p>
<p class="i2">   And stationed His rangers to guard the lines. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Then the White Man came, as the East growed old, </p>
<p class="i4">     And blazed his trail with the wreck of war. </p>
<p class="i2">   He riled the rivers to hunt for gold </p>
<p class="i4">     And found the stuff he was lookin' for; </p>
<p class="i2">   Then he trampled the Injun trails to ruts </p>
<p class="i2">   And gashed through the hills with railroad cuts. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   He flung out his barb-wire fences wide </p>
<p class="i4">     And plowed up the ground where the grass was high. </p>
<p class="i2">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>[72]</span>

                 He stripped off the trees from the mountain side </p>
<p class="i4">     And ground out his ore where the streams run by, </p>
<p class="i2">   Till last came the cities, with smoke and roar, </p>
<p class="i2">   And the White Man was feelin' at home once more. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But Barrenness, Loneliness, suchlike things </p>
<p class="i4">     That gall and grate on the White Man's nerves, </p>
<p class="i2">   Was the rangers that camped by the bitter springs </p>
<p class="i4">     And guarded the lines of God's reserves. </p>
<p class="i2">   So the folks all shy from the desert land, </p>
<p class="i2">   'Cept mebbe a few that kin understand. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   There the world's the same as the day 'twas new, </p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>[73]</span>

                 And never a noise as the years have flew, </p>

<p class="i2">   And there, alone, with the man's world far, </p>
<p class="i2">   There's a chance to think who you really are. </p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   North, where the hurrying seasons changed </p>
<p class="i4">     Over great gray plains where the trails lay long, </p>
<p class="i2">   Free as the sweeping Chinook we ranged, </p>
<p class="i4">     Setting our days to a saddle song. </p>
<p class="i2">   Through the icy challenge you flung to us, </p>
<p class="i2">   Through your shy Spring kisses that clung to us, </p>
<p class="i4">     Following far as the rainbow spanned, </p>
<p class="i4">     Fiercely we wooed you, young, young land! </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   South, where the sullen black mountains guard </p>
<p class="i4">     Limitless, shimmering lands of the sun, </p>
<p class="i2">   Over blinding trails where the hoofs rang hard, </p>
<p class="i4">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>[84]</span>

                   Laughing or cursing, we rode and won. </p>
<p class="i2">   Drunk with the virgin white fire of you, </p>
<p class="i2">   Hotter than thirst was desire of you; </p>
<p class="i4">     Straight in our faces you burned your brand, </p>
<p class="i4">     Marking your chosen ones, young, young land. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   When did we long for the sheltered gloom </p>
<p class="i4">     Of the older game with its cautious odds? </p>
<p class="i2">   Gloried we always in sun and room, </p>
<p class="i4">     Spending our strength like the younger gods. </p>
<p class="i2">   By the wild sweet ardor that ran in us, </p>
<p class="i2">   By the pain that tested the man in us, </p>
<p class="i4">     By the shadowy springs and the glaring sand, </p>
<p class="i4">     You were our true-love, young, young land. </p>

                 When the last free trail is a prim, fenced lane </p>
<p class="i4">     And our graves grow weeds through forgetful Mays, </p>
<p class="i2">   Richer and statelier then you'll reign, </p>
<p class="i4">     Mother of men whom the world will praise. </p>
<p class="i2">   And your sons will love you and sigh for you, </p>
<p class="i2">   Labor and battle and die for you, </p>
<p class="i4">     But never the fondest will understand </p>
<p class="i4">     The way we have loved you, young, young land. </p>

    THE WESTERNER

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   My fathers sleep on the sunrise plains, </p>
<p class="i4">     And each one sleeps alone. </p>
<p class="i2">   Their trails may dim to the grass and rains, </p>
<p class="i4">     For I choose to make my own. </p>
<p class="i2">   I lay proud claim to their blood and name, </p>
<p class="i4">     But I lean on no dead kin; </p>
<p class="i2">   My name is mine, for the praise or scorn, </p>
<p class="i2">   And the world began when I was born </p>
<p class="i4">     And the world is mine to win. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   They built high towns on their old log sills, </p>
<p class="i4">     Where the great, slow rivers gleamed, </p>
<p class="i2">   But with new, live rock from the savage hills </p>
<p class="i4">     I'll build as they only dreamed. </p>
<p class="i2">   The smoke scarce dies where the trail camp lies, </p>
<p class="i4">     Till the rails glint down the pass; </p>
<p class="i2">   The desert springs into fruit and wheat </p>
<p class="i2">   And I lay the stones of a solid street </p>
<p class="i4">     Over yesterday's untrod grass. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>[87]</span>

                 I waste no thought on my neighbor's birth </p>
<p class="i4">     Or the way he makes his prayer. </p>
<p class="i2">   I grant him a white man's room on earth </p>
<p class="i4">     If his game is only square. </p>
<p class="i2">   While he plays it straight I'll call him mate; </p>
<p class="i4">     If he cheats I drop him flat. </p>
<p class="i2">   Old class and rank are a wornout lie, </p>
<p class="i2">   For all clean men are as good as I, </p>
<p class="i4">     And a king is only that. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   I dream no dreams of a nurse-maid state </p>
<p class="i4">     That will spoon me out my food. </p>
<p class="i2">   A stout heart sings in the fray with fate </p>
<p class="i4">     And the shock and sweat are good. </p>
<p class="i2">   From noon to noon all the earthly boon </p>
<p class="i4">     That I ask my God to spare </p>
<p class="i2">   Is a little daily bread in store, </p>
<p class="i2">   With the room to fight the strong for more, </p>

<p class="i2">   But I stand here, where the bright skies blaze </p>
<p class="i4">     Over me and the big today. </p>
<p class="i2">   What good to me is a vague "may be" </p>
<p class="i4">     Or a mournful "might have been," </p>
<p class="i2">   For the sun wheels swift from morn to morn </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
